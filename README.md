## Overview
The notebook demonstrates essential steps for:
- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature selection
- Training and evaluating classification models

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data). It includes various features computed from digitized images of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.

## Notebook
The notebook provides a hands-on walkthrough for beginners to understand machine learning concepts and apply them effectively.
